title_description: "I'm a seasoned professional immersed in the dynamic realm of DevOps engineering, boasting over 4 years of hands-on experience. 
<br /> My journey in technology is characterized by an insatiable passion for exploration and experimentation, always pushing the boundaries to advance the principles and practices of DevOps.
<br /> In addition to my extensive experience, I offer expertise in DevOps consultation, specializing in optimizing workflows and infrastructure to drive efficiency and innovation. 
<br /> As a former Senior DevOps Engineer at ficode, I've honed my skills in orchestrating intricate systems and cultivating collaborative environments where teams thrive.
<br />
<br /> My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Amity University, Noida, India, providing me with a solid foundation to excel in the field.
<br />
<br /> Notably, I had the privilege of being a <strong>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student under Debian in 2020</strong>, contributing to the Android SDK Projectâ€”a testament to my dedication to open-source initiatives and continuous learning. 
<br /> My involvement extends across diverse open-source projects, encompassing Android development, web development, Docker, and more.
<br /> Within the Debian community, I actively participate in various teams, including JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Android, Java, Medical, Python, and package security. 
<br /> Additionally, I'm deeply engaged in projects such as Hamaralinux.org and yogdaan.org, where I foster open-source collaboration and innovation."
